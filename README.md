# Sistemi Operativi
This is a repository for *all my personal exam solutions* of Sistemi Operativi course in Unimore. For legal reasons I can not attach the relatives exam tests, but if you need to *undestrand completely* what my code does, or you're just *curious* about what kind of exams this repository provide a solution to, you can find all exam tests here : https://github.com/letizialeonardi/SOeLab22-23/tree/main/Esami .

All legal references are from Professor Letizia Leonardi (https://github.com/letizialeonardi) and the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.

This repository contains only my personal code, and its purpose is to provide a record for my personal journey in @Unimore and maybe helping someone out there.
